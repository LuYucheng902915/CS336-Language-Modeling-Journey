# 🚀 CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch - My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository for Stanford's CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch (Spring 2025). This repository serves as my digital garden, documenting my process of understanding, implementing, and reflecting on the core concepts of modern large language models.

## About This Project

This project is my hands-on implementation and detailed note-taking for the CS336 course. My goal is not only to complete the assignments but also to build a deep, first-principles understanding of how LLMs work.

**Core Technologies:**
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
- Jupyter Notebook
